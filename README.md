- POST API routes are set up for creating a new user and creating a new thought.
- PUT API routes are set up for updating a user and updating a thought.
- A DELETE API route is set up for deleting a user by id which will also delete all of their thoughts. _\*See [Known Problems](#known-problems)_

## Known Problems

If a user's username changes and that user is then deleted, the cascading delete functionality for that user's thoughts will not work. Presently, thoughts are connected to users by the user's username. The thought should be connected to the user by the user id to avoid this bug.
